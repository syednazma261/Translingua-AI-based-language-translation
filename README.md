##  How to Run the Project

### 1️. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/abubakarmr/TransLingua.git
```
2. Create virtual environment (one time)
```bash
python -m venv venv
```
3. Activate virtual environment
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```
 You’ll see (venv) in terminal — that means it worked 

4.  Install dependencies (VERY IMPORTANT)
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

(Do this once after activating venv)

5. Run the Streamlit app
```bash
streamlit run translang.py
```
OR (safer version, always works):
```bash
python -m streamlit run translang.py
```
